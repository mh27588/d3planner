 <h3>For California Residents: CCPA Information</h3>
 <p>This Privacy Notice for California Residents supplements the information contained elsewhere in this Privacy Notice and applies solely to all visitors, users, and others who reside in the State of California (“consumers” or “you”). We adopt this notice to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) and any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this notice.</p>

 <h3>Rights and Choices</h3>
 <p>The CCPA provides consumers located in the state of California with certain rights regarding their personal information and data. The following section describes those rights and explains how to exercise them:</p>

 <h3>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights</h3>
 <p>You have the right to request that the company disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (as described in the section “Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights”), we will disclose to you:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>
  <li>The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</li>
  <li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.</li>
  <li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.</li>

  <li>If we sold or disclose your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:<ul>
   <li>Sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased, and</li>
   <li>Disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained</li>
  </ul></li>
 </ul>

 </ul>
 <p>Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects.</p>

 <h3>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</h3>
 <p>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by emailing us at d07.riv@gmail.com</p>
 <p>Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>
 <p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access of data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
  <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
